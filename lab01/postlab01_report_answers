Lab01 Lab Questions:


Understand which IO pins are being utilized and what is being done in loop(), and implement the
setup() accordingly. You will need to use the function pinMode().
Q1: 

Q2: lower resistor -> brighter light

Q3:	Part A: setting baudrate to 115200
	Part B: reading incoming character from the Serial Monitor (one byte) and prints its ASCII code in decimal,
	the delay is then being modified by the value of the character.
	Higher values means more delay (slower blinking).
	
Q4:	&incoming gives the integer pointer of the variable incoming and (char*) casts the integer
	pointer to a character pointer. We need to do that because the function 'readBytes'
	expects characters.

Q5:	They are being interpreted as ISO latin (8bit ASCII).

Q6:	8

Q7:	ASCII until 127.

Q8:	We'd need to write '='.
